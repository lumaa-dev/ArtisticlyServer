# File format
All songs must use the `.mp3`, `.wav` or `.m4a` format.

The naming comes like this `[song-id]-[0 = hidden, 1 = public]-[anything you want]`, the song id is an integer\
Public songs are accessible by any user, while hidden songs are only accessible via the access code set in the [`config.json` file](../config.json).
